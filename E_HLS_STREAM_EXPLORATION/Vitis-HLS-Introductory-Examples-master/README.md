## C/C++ synthesizable examples

Each example comes with C/C++ source code, a README, and script or config file.
The examples are organized in categories denoted by the directory names:
* Appnotes: A DSP design, a legacy digital up converter appnote.
* Array: Show how to partition memory arrays.
* Interface: Common examples for interface protocols.
* Misc.: Other examples such as the RTL blackbox flow and the LogiCore FFT from Vivado.
* Modelling: The essentials for loops, arbitrary precision types and vectors.
* Pipelining: Illustrating one of the most fundamental concept of HLS.
* Task_Level_Parallelism: Dataflow and free running streams with hls::task.
* Vitis: Kernel examples for the software acceleration flow.

## Running the examples at the command line

* Using Vitis Unified IDE:
  - ```vitis-run --mode hls --tcl run_hls.tcl```
* Using Vitis HLS (deprecated):
  - ```vitis_hls -f run_hls.tcl```

Note that by default only C simulation and C synthesis will run. Change the value of hls_exec in the Tcl script to run co-simulation and Vivado implementation.
